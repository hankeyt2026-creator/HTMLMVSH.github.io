    <h1>T-Rex With Chainsaw Arms Causes Chaos at Battle Creek Home Depot</h1>
    <h3>A Tyrannical T-Rex Tide</h3>
    <hr>
    <p> <strong>BATTLE CREEK, MI</strong>— Shoppers at the Home Depot on Beckley Road were met with an unexpected prehistoric surprise Tuesday morning when a 20-foot-tall Tyrannosaurus rex — equipped with what witnesses described as <blockqoute>“fully functional chainsaw arms”</blockqoute> — rampaged through the lumber aisle.<br>
<!-- I know it looks sketch that I know CSS, but i was taught it pretty recently by a class offered at Olivet -->

According to employees, the creature burst through the garden center doors shortly after 9 a.m., roaring loudly and revving its chainsaw appendages in what one customer called “a very confident, DIY‑ready manner.” <br>

<blockqoute>“I came in for a new drill bit,”</blockqoute> said local resident Mark Ellison, “and suddenly there’s this giant dinosaur trimming the end caps off shelving units like it’s prepping for a weekend project. I’ve never seen anything like it.” <br>

Store security footage shows the T‑rex knocking over displays of mulch, slicing through several 2x4s with surprising precision, and briefly attempting to operate a forklift before becoming distracted by the bright orange paint samples. <br>

Authorities arrived within minutes, though officers admitted they were <blockqoute>“not fully trained for dinosaur‑with‑power‑tools scenarios.”</blockqoute> The creature eventually wandered out of the store and into the parking lot, where it reportedly became fascinated by a row of inflatable holiday decorations. <br>

No injuries were reported, though the store estimates damages in the <blockqoute>“high tens of thousands,”</blockqoute> mostly in lumber, shelving, and one very unfortunate riding lawn mower. <br>

Scientists from Western Michigan University have been called in to investigate how a Cretaceous-era predator ended up in Calhoun County — and more importantly, how it managed to obtain chainsaw arms. <br>

Home Depot has announced it will reopen after <blockqoute>“a thorough cleanup and a review of our dinosaur‑related safety protocols.”</blockqoute> <br> </p>
